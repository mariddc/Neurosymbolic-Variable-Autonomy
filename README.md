# Neurosymbolic-Variable-Autonomy
This PRIM (Research and Innovation Master Project) project is part of the MSc in Engineering program at Télécom Paris.

It is mainly based on the [Negotiating Control: Neurosymbolic Variable Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16254) paper by Georgios Bakirtzis, Manolis Chiou, and Andreas Theodorou.

### Goal
In what ways can symbolic logic contribute to improving learning efficiency and operational safety in a transparent variable-autonomy negotiation framework?

Showing improvements in safety and a functioning negotiation layer is important for interpretability, which could increase understanding and trust on variable autonomy systems.
